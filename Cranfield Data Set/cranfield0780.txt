an investigation to determine the effects of camber on the aerodynamic characteristics of a series of rectangular wings having various aspect ratios and thickness to chord ratios was conducted in the ames the transonic bump method  the mach number range of the investigation was from 06 to 112 with a corresponding reynolds number range of 17 to 22 million   the lift drag and pitching moment data are presented for wings having aspect ratios of 4 3 2 15 and 1 and naca 63a2xx and 63a4xx sections with thickness to chord ratios of
