the effect of air drag on satellite orbits of eccentricity e less than between 02 and 1 is presented  equations are derived which show how perigee distance and orbital period vary with eccentricity during the satellite's life and how eccentricity is related to timeand formulae are obtained for the lifetime and the air density at perigee in terms of the rate of change of period  the results are also presented graphically and their implications and limitations are discussed
