brief description of experiments performed by using shock tube techniques for measurement of the stagnation point heating of a blunt body over a stagnation enthalpy range of 650 to 900 corresponding to velocities between 32000 ft per sec and 39000 ft per sec respectively   data thus provided are used for comparison with theory
