an experimental investigation was conducted at a mach number of 62 to determine the static longitudinal stability characteristics of a model of a blunted glider reentry configuration having 795degree sweepback and 45degree dihedral  the free stream reynolds number for the investigation was 30 x 10 based on the basic model length of 75 inches  tests were made through an angle of attack range from 0degrees to investigation showed that incorporating 10degree nose incidence in the basic model resulted in a lower lift curve slope a lower lift drag ratio a higher value of trim lift coefficient and a decrease in static  longitudinal stability  in comparison the effect of extending the configuration length and incorporating 10degrees and 20degrees boattail angles resulted in smaller changes in the longitudinal stability characteristics of the model
