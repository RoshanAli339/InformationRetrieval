interferometric measurements were made of the density profiles of an unsteady turbulent boundary layer on the flat wall of a shock tube  the investigation included both subsonic and supersonic flow (mach numbers of 050 and 177) with no pressure gradient and with heat transfer to a cold wall   velocity profiles and average skin friction coefficients were calculated   effects on the velocity profile of surface roughness and flow length are examined
