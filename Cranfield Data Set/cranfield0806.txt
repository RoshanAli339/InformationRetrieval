the intensity of shock wave noise at the ground resulting from flights at mach numbers to 20 and altitudes to 60000 feet was measured   measurements near the ground track for flights of a supersonic fighter and one flight of a supersonic bomber are presented    level cruising flight at an altitude of 60000 feet and a mach number of 20 produced sonic booms which were considered to be tolerable and it is reasonable to expect that cruising flight at higher altitudes will produce booms of tolerable intensity for airplanes of the size and weight of the test airplanes   the measured variation of sonic boom intensity with altitude was in good agreement with the variation calculated by an equation given in nasa technical note d 48    the effect of mach number on the ground overpressure is small between mach numbers of 14 and 20 a result in agreement with the theory   no amplification of the shock wave overpressures due to refraction effects was apparent near the cutoff mach number    a method for estimating the effect of flight path angle on cutoff mach number is shown   experimental results indicate agreement with the method since a climb maneuver produced booms of a much decreased intensity as compared with the intensity of those measured in level flight at about the same altitude and mach number    comparison of sound pressure levels for the fighter and bomber airplanes indicated little effect of either airplane size or weight at an altitude of 40000 feet
