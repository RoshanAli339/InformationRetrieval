a modified method of van driest's flat plate theory for turbulent boundary layer has been found to simplify the calculation of local skinfriction coefficients which in turn have made it possible to obtain through reynolds analogy theoretical turbulent heat transfer coefficients in the form of stanton number   a general formula is given and charts are presented from which the modified method can be solved for mach numbers 10 to 120 temperature ratios 02 to 60 and reynolds numbers 02 x 10 to 200 x 10
