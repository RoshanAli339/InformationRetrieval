schlieren photographs have been taken of the flow over conecylinder flare bodies to study the extent of boundary layer separation due to the presence of rocket jet plumes   tests were made of three conecylinder flare configurations in the langley 11 inch hypersonic tunnel at a mach number of 965 and in the langley unitary plan wind tunnel at a mach number of 465 with two additional configurations   the stream reynolds number varied from approximately 317000 to 582000 based on model length   the conical flares had half angles of 7 or 13 and contained one of two test nozzles with a design mach number of 372 or 453  the test nozzles were operated with compressed air and were designed to simulate a solid propellant rocket motor operating at altitudes between to free stream static pressure ratio varied from jet off to 1150 for the test nozzle with a design mach number of 372 and from jet off to mach number of 453   for most of the tests the angle of attack range was 0 to  4 some additional tests were made at 2 and 4    measurements taken from flow pictures indicated that at zero angle of attack on all configurations tested with jet on the boundary layer separates ahead of the flare cylinder juncture and the separation point moves toward the cone cylinder juncture with an increase in pressure ratio   increasing angle of attack reduced the extent of boundary layer separation on the windward side as did increasing the stream mach number from 465 to 965   other parameters which tended to reduce the extent of boundary layer separation were  number (b) decreasing stream reynolds number and (c) displacing nozzle exit rearward
