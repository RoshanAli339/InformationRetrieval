tests have been conducted at a mach number of 6 in the pibal hypersonic facility in order to determine the heat transfer and pressure distributions over a slender blunted cone at angles of attack of erature ratio stagnation to wall was approximately 23   the model tested has a sperical nose diameter of 10 in a base diameter of 375 in and a cone half angle of 20 degrees   the measurements were made at 5 peripheral stations on the model  in this note the experimental results at a 15 degree angle of attack are presented   a more detailed analysis of the results for all angles of attack is presented in reference 1
