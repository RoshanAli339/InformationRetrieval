the effects of jet pluming on normal force and pitching moment of have been measured at a free stream mach number of 965 with reynolds numbers based on model length of 500000 to 600000   geometric variables included nose bluntness flare half angle and nozzle geometry and exit displacement  two test nozzles with design mach numbers of 374 and 460 were operated with compressed air to simulate the initial jet boundary shape of a particular solid propellant rocket motor operating between altitudes of 165000 and 215000 feet  the ratio of the jet pressure to free stream static pressure varied from a jet off condition to approximately 1300 for the nozzle with design mach number of 374 and from a jet off condition to approximately 280 for the nozzle with design mach number of 460  the angle of attack range was from 0 to approximately 6    the results indicate that as the jet pressure ratio was increased the size of the jet plume increased and as a result the model static stability was decreased   increasing the angle of attack resulted in a reduction in static instability during the jet on condition   increasing nose bluntness resulted in a more forward movement of the center of pressure when jet plume interference was not present and a rearward movement in the center of pressure when jet interference was present   increasing the nozzle area expansion ratio and displacing the nozzle exit downstream of the flare base resulted in a more rearward location of the center of pressure
