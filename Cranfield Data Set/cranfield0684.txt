the present paper contains a set of tables of complete elliptic integrals computed and collected especially for applications to certain dynamical problems  the tabulated functions are four in number and are denoted by fa ga ea andabrespectively  the definitions of these functions and their connections with the functions of legendre will be discussed in the following
