an experimental investigation has been conducted in the 26 inch langley transonic blowdown tunnel to determine effects of center of gravity location on the transonic flutter characteristics of a 45degree sweptback wing plan form of aspect ratio 40 and taper ratio 06  solidconstruction models of the plan form with streamwise naca 65a004 airfoil sections and center of gravity locations at approximately 34 percent chord 46 percent chord and 58 percent chord respectively were fluttered at several mach numbers between 08 and 135  it was found that for streamwise mach numbers from 08 to 10 the variation with mach number of the ratio of experimental flutter speed to  a calculated incompressible flutter speed was not affected by centerof gravity location  however for mach numbers from 10 to 135 there was an increase in flutter speed ratio with mach number which was different for each center of gravity position  data from wings with successively more forward center of gravity locations showed successively larger values of flutter speed ratio at mach numbers from 10 to
