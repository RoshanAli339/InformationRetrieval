direct pitching moment derivatives have been measured using the method of scruton woodgate et al for two single wedge blunt nosed aerofoils  these measurements were made at mach numbers of 175 and 247 and frequency parameters less than 002  in general nose blunting was found to have little effect on the derivatives although changes were observed for the thinner wedge at a mach number of 175
