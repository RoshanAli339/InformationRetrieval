thesecond methodof lyapunov is the most general approach currently in the theory of stability of dynamic systems  after a rigorous exposition  of the fundamental concepts of this theory applications are made toa stability of linear stationary linear nonslationary and nonlinear systemsbestimation of transient behaviorccontrol system optimizationddesign of relay servos  the discussion is essentially self contained with emphasis on the thorough development of the principal ideas and mathematical tools  only systems governed by differential equations are treated here  systems governed by difference equations are the subject of a companion paper
