the model was tested at two different elevations with the wing pivot at 1008 and 2425 propeller diameters above the ground   the slipstream of the propellers was deflected by tilting the wing and propellers by deflections of large chord trailing edge flaps and by combinations of flap deflection and wing tilt   tests were conducted over a range of propeller disk loadings from 741 to 2970 pounds per square foot   force data for the complete model and pressure distributions for the wing and flaps behind one propeller were recorded and are presented in tabular form without analysis
