shock wave ground pressure measurements have been made for supersonic bomber airplanes in the mach number range from 124 to 152 for altitudes from about 30000 to 50000 feet and for a gross weight range from about 83000 to 120000 pounds   the measured overpressures were generally higher than would be predicted by the theory which accounts only for volume effects   there is thus a suggestion that lift effects on sonic boom intensity may be significant for this type of airplane for the altitude range of the present tests
