a variable capacitance ablation rate sensor which allows continuous measurements of ablation rates for teflon and similar polymers has been developed and tested in an ethylene heated high temperature jet at stagnation temperatures ranging from 2400degree to 3800degree f  the data length changes were measured by using the same telemeter equipment as that used in rocket propelled flight vehicles  test results indicate measurement error to be a maximum of 4 percent between the telemetered length changes and the length changes that were obtained  from photographic records of the test
