the effect of mach number variation from 18 to 74 on boundary layer transition was investigated on a slender fin stabilized ogive cylinder body in free flight at a constant length reynolds number of 138 million  the wall to free stream temperature ratio was constant at a value of 10 below mach number 45 and at a value of of the test showed that increasing mach number had a very favorable effect of increasing the extent of the laminar boundary layer for a given surface roughness   the transition data when plotted as a function of a factor indicative of heat transfer showed that heat transfer was possibly responsible for a good deal of the increase in transition reynolds number with mach number    transition was found to occur farther forward on the sheltered side of the body than on the windward side for angles of attack as low as 04 and for all mach numbers   the pressure rise along sheltered side streamlines was examined and it was found that the pressure rise coefficient at the transition point showed no variation with mach number   data from other sources for different test conditions when reduced to values of pressure rise coefficient were also found to correlate well with that of the present investigation with the exception of data at low subsonic mach numbers   these present results also show that mach number surface roughness pressure rise and length reynolds number all affected boundary layer transition in the region of theoretical infinite laminar stability to small two dimensional disturbances as calculated for a flat plate with zero pressure gradient
