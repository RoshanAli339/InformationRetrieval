data are presented which were obtained from a transonic wind tunnel investigation of a reentry glider having folding wing tip panels  the tests were conducted at angles of attack from  4degrees to 99degrees  the reynolds number based on the mean geometric chord of the fixed planform varied from 235 x 10 to 299 x 10  the maximum lift drag ratio for the model with the folding wing tip panels fully extended decreased from a maximum value of 78 at a mach number of 060 to about 34 at mach numbers from 103 to 120  the model with the folding wing panels fully extended was stable for values of the lift coefficient from 0 up to at least 08  above this lift coefficient pitch up tendencies were observed followed by an unstable or neutrally stable region which extended up to values of angle of attack of 50degrees or 60degrees  deflecting the folding wing panels between ducing a significant change in the trim angle of attack or in any of the  force or moment coefficients in the angle of attack range from 49degree to 99degree
